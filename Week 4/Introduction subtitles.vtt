00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.880
Welcome to the fourth week of the course.

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.370
Up to this point we've talked
at a very skills level.

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.750
In week one, we talked about to use
Python to interact with and process data.

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.170
In week two,
we introduced the pandas library and

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.530
tabular data in the form of Series and
DataFrames.

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.450
In week three, we deepened our
knowledge how to use pandas by

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.180
grouping data, applying functions, and
merging data sets.

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.820
In week four of the course, we want to
introduce the course project, which

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.137
will test your ability to use the skills
you developed in weeks one through three.

10
00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:43.110
The goal of this project is to help
you not only practice those skills but

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.120
to start building up a portfolio of
real world data science problems,

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.480
which you can use to demonstrate your
ability to acquire, manipulate, clean, and

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.970
run basic data analyses.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.920
Before we get to the project though, I
want to put fresh in your mind a few core

15
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.610
statistics concepts that will help ground
your further studies in data science.

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.601
And keep in mind that this isn't a full-on
statistics course by any means, so

17
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.590
I would encourage you to check out the
many statistics learning options on this

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.746
platform and others.

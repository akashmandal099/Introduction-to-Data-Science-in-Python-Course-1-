00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.420
This week we're going to deepen our
investigation to how Python can be used to

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.300
manipulate, clean, and query data by
looking at the Pandas data tool kit.

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.340
Pandas was created by
Wes McKinney in 2008, and

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.680
is an open source project under
a very permissive license.

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.240
As an open source project
it's got a strong community,

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.980
with 100 software developers all
committing code to help make it better.

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.590
There's a couple of places you should
consider going to for help with Pandas.

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.960
Obviously, the course discussion
forums make for a great resource.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.515
But I don't think they're
the best resource for

10
00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.410
Pandas problems in particular.

11
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.430
I think the best resource is a question
answering site called Stack Overflow.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.220
Stack Overflow is used broadly within
the software development community to post

13
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.490
questions about programming, programming
languages, and programming toolkits.

14
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.590
What's special about Stack Overflow
is that it's heavily curated by

15
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.220
the community.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.550
And the Pandas community, in particular,
uses it as their number one resource for

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130
helping new members.

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.830
It's quite possible if you post
a question to Stack Overflow, and

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.100
tag it as being Pandas and

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.760
Python related, that a Pandas developer
will actually respond to your question.

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.450
In addition to posting questions,
Stack Overflow is a great place to go

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.540
to see what issues people are having and
how they can be solved.

23
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.899
You can learn a lot from browsing
Stacks at Stack Overflow.

24
00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.357
A second resource you might
want to consider are books.

25
00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:28.641
In 2012 Wes McKinney wrote the definitive
Pandas reference book called Python for

26
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.590
Data Analysis and published by O'Reilly.

27
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.310
While it's starting to get a bit dated,

28
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.880
he recently announced that a new
edition of the book is coming, and

29
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.110
I still consider this a go to book for
understanding how Pandas works.

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.230
I also appreciate the more brief
book Leaning the Pandas Library by

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.580
Matt Harrison.

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.840
It's not a comprehensive book
on data analysis and statistics.

33
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.100
But if you just want to learn
the basics of Pandas and

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.770
want to do so quickly,
I think it's a well laid out volume.

35
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.490
The field of data science
is rapidly changing.

36
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.620
There's new toolkits and
method being created everyday.

37
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.630
It can be tough to stay on top of it all.

38
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.780
And Marco Rodriguez and

39
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.100
Tim Golden maintained a wonderful blog
aggregator site called Planet Python.

40
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.360
You can visit the webpage at
planetpython.org, subscribe with an RSS

41
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.240
reader, or get the latest articles
from the @PlanetPython Twitter feed.

42
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.080
There's lots of regular Python
data science contributors, and

43
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.190
I highly recommend it if
you follow RSS feeds.

44
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.550
Here's my last plug on how
to deepen your learning.

45
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.020
Kyle Polich runs an excellent
podcast called Data Skeptic.

46
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.216
Well, it isn't Python based per se,
it's well produced and

47
00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.397
it has a wonderful mixture of interviews
with experts in the field as well as short

48
00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:36.010
educational lessons.

49
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.280
Much of the word he describes is
specific to machine learning methods.

50
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.620
But if that's something you are planning
to explore through this specialization

51
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
this course is in, I would really
encourage you to subscribe to his podcast.

52
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.380
Well that's it for a little bit
of an introduction to this week.

53
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.190
Next we're going to dive right into Pandas
and talk about the series data structure.

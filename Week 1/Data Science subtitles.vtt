1
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.364
Interest in data science
is at an all time high, and

2
00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:15.240
really has exploded in popularity
in the last couple of years.

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.890
A fun way to see this is to hit
up the Google Trends website.

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.470
Google Trends shows search
keyword information over time.

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.650
We could see that the term ‘data
science’ is massively popular,

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.370
really all across the globe.

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.840
We can also see that related
queries include topics like python.

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.190
And we can even see certain tool kits
that we’ll be teaching in this course.

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.070
For instance, here's the trend for

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.289
python pandas, which is the focus of
module two and three in this course.

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.500
Before we jump in to a discussion of data
science, I'd like to take a moment and

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.680
have you reflect on what you
think data science is, and

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.390
why you came to this course to explore.

14
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.110
If someone you ran into asked you
what data science was all about,

15
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.248
what would you tell them?

16
00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.226
The history of data science goes
back a little further than 2004,

17
00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.664
which is where the Google
search term history begins.

18
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:11.890
But this, at least, gives a sense for
how popular the area is now.

19
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.470
I think the popularity of interest in
the area comes from the network and

20
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.950
data driven society we
find ourselves living in.

21
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.190
When people think of
the term data scientist,

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.470
they tend to think of Google or
Amazon or Facebook,

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.790
places with big artificial intelligence
research teams, and certainly these

24
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.790
are some amazing companies who are doing
great things with data science.

25
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.480
But data scientist aren’t just limited
to careers with tech companies.

26
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.940
Almost every company is turning to data
science to better understand how to build

27
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.200
products, serve customers and
leverage new opportunities.

28
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.480
And companies aren't the only one. 
In this first course I will be giving

29
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.430
lectures here in the University of
Michigan digital innovation greenhouse.

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.040
Which was a lab within the office
of academic innovation.

31
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.030
The space is used by a team which includes
programmers, behavioral scientists and

32
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.410
data scientists who aim to build
technologies to support next generation

33
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.210
teaching and learning.

34
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.650
The background of individuals
here is very broad and

35
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.350
includes folks with computer science and

36
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.190
information degrees, psychology
degrees, and law and business degrees.

37
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.210
And here they apply data driven
methodologies to aid in their discovery,

38
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.920
from statistical analysis,
machine learning and

39
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240
text mining, to information visualization.

40
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.320
And this need for data driven intelligence
and skills is growing in companies and

41
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.090
organizations throughout the world.

42
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.610
Let's start with a look at the roots
of the field of data science.

43
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.200
The techniques and methodologies of data
science stem from the fields of computer

44
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.290
science and statistics.

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.670
One of the most well cited diagrams
describing the field comes from Drew Conway

46
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.240
where he suggested data science is
the intersection of hacking skills,

47
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.010
math and stats knowledge,
and substantial expertise.

48
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.580
This diagram might be a bit
of an oversimplification, but

49
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.290
I think it's a great start.

50
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.580
Data science is definitely one of those
areas where you ask ten people and

51
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.679
get ten different answers.

52
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.210
One thing that I think is missing from
this diagram is the underlining need for

53
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.770
the scientific inquiry.

54
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.720
You don't necessarily get this for
having good hacking skills or math and

55
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240
statistic knowledge.

56
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.270
A good data scientist bring skepticism,
experimentation,

57
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.050
simulation, and replication to bear
on understanding a given phenomena.

58
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.860
Whether it be trying to predict sales
at the coffee shop, cluster products in

59
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.720
an online store, determine who's
likely to win in election or

60
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.890
mine health data from
physiological sensors like Fitbits.

61
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.040
In this specialization we're going to
touch on all of these issue broadly but

62
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.390
really focus on skills.

63
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.260
In addition to the hacking
skills Conway mentions,

64
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.570
we're going to develop some communication
skills in the form of charting,

65
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.360
graphing, and related visualizations.

66
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.460
A good data scientist is one who can
communicate their findings clearly to

67
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.510
others and having some fundamental
tools in the toolkit as useful here.

68
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.670
We can find a more comprehensive and
academic discussion in the work of

69
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.930
David Donoho,
Professor of Statistics in Stanford.

70
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.380
Who's providing excellent commentary
of views of the field in

71
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.240
a paper entitled 50 years of data science.

72
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.260
We've provided a link to
that in a course resources.

73
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.250
There's lots to think
about with this paper,

74
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.040
but I want to draw your
attention to section 8,

75
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.310
where he describes the field broadly as
being made up of six activities.

76
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.790
The first of these is Data Exploration and

77
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.040
Preparation, this involves cleaning data
and manipulating it for further analysis.

78
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.970
The second is Data Representation and
Transformation.

79
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.100
This specialization is going to
look at several different forms of

80
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.370
representing data.

81
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.485
Tabular structures in the first course,
text data in the fourth course, and

82
00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:46.760
graph-based data in the last course.

83
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.260
These are just some of the kinds of data
you have to deal with as a data scientist.

84
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.650
The third activity is Computing with
Data, and Donoho mentioned specifically

85
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.740
the languages of R and
Python as being fundamental here.

86
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.520
He goes further and
he talks about pipelining and

87
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.190
how data scientist need to be able
to work with different languages for

88
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.080
different parts on an analysis project and
I think this is very true.

89
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.830
Unlike enterprise software projects,
where you might use one language for

90
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.770
implementing all of
the functionality you need.

91
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.330
Modern data science projects can
span many different languages and

92
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.110
computing paradigms.

93
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.390
Knowing when to use the right tool for
the job is an important attribute.

94
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.760
The fourth activity is Data Modeling.
I think data modeling is a big space but

95
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.950
Donoho speaks specifically
about predictive modeling,

96
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.000
which we’ll talk about in the third
MOOC in this specialization and

97
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.730
generative modeling.

98
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.190
There's some fundamental differences here,
and I think the increased interest in

99
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.610
predictive modeling is helping to
fuel the current data science push.

100
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.890
In particular, the modern world,
with massive data streams and

101
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.230
significant computational power,

102
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.250
gives us opportunity to rapidly
experiment with making predictions.

103
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.340
Allowing us to innovate and
evaluate new data science techniques.

104
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.380
The fifth activity is
Data Visualization and Presentation.

105
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.580
Now the word visualization brings with it
a number of connotations, such as charting

106
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.030
and graphing, as well as 3D visualizations
and interactive environments.

107
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.930
In the second course we'll learn the
basics of information visualization, but

108
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.380
keep in mind that info viz
is a whole field of its own.

109
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.440
Finally, Donoho suggests there's sort
of a meta activity which he calls

110
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.720
the science about data science.

111
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.420
That is understanding what works and
what doesn't in data science, and

112
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.960
building ways to leverage
these discoveries.

113
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.680
We see examples of this as new tools and

114
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.280
paradigms of computing are invented
to change the way data science works.

115
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.700
I think Donoho provides a really nice
overview of the area of the data science.

116
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.330
In his paper he also alludes
to several investments,

117
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.960
research institutions are
putting into the field.

118
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.600
Including the University of California
in Berkeley, New York University,

119
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.060
MIT and the University in Michigan, here,

120
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.900
which just kicked off a $100
million data science initiative.

121
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.340
Data science is becoming a fundamental
way of understanding the world around us.

122
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.770
While many institutions, including my own,

123
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.020
are starting to offer data science
masters degrees and certificate.

124
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.550
I think it's important to think of data
science as a sort of epistemology, or

125
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.830
a way of knowing.

126
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.850
Data science thinking can be useful in
a variety of disciplines and careers.

127
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.990
It is a way of approaching problems and
critical thinking skills.

128
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.200
But this is a skills based course, so in
the next lecture we're going to jump right

129
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.650
in and start talking about
the Python programming language.
